Description: GIT-based Configuration Tracking Utility (GCFG)
 The objective of the GIT-based Configuration Tracking Utility (GCFG) is to
 allow the tracking and versioning of (mostly configuration) files on a system,
 in a manner that makes it easy to have a global overview of how the system is
 configured and what changes were made.
 .
 By default, it uses a centralized repository in '/etc/gcfg' (though an alternate
 directory may be specified when configuring the utility). This directory holds:
 .
  * a GIT (sub-)repository ('/etc/gcfg/git'), used for versioning changes
 .
  * an "original" (sub-)repository ('/etc/gcfg/original'), used to keep a
    copy of original files
 .
  * a "flag" (sub-)repository ('/etc/gcfg/flag'), used to associate flags
    to files
 .
  * a packages listing file ('/etc/gcfg/pkglist'), which lists all the packages
    that are marked as "manually" installed
 .
 Before issuing any 'gcfg' commands, one may first configure the utility environ-
 ment (GCFG_* variables) using the 'source gcfg' command.
 .
 When a file is added ('gcfg add'), copied ('gcfg copy') or edited ('gcfg edit'):
 .
  1. It is first moved within the scope of the GIT (sub-)repository.
     GIT commands ('gcfg git ...') then allows to keep track of all changes
     made to that file.
 .
  2. The GIT-tracked file is then linked back to its original/standard location,
     using either:
       - hard linking, by default
       - symbolic linking, in special directories like '/etc/cron.d'
       - file copy, when filesystems boundaries are crossed
 .
  3. When specified, a copy of the original version is kept in the "original"
     (sub-)repository.
     The original version is then always handy thanks to the 'gcfg orig'
     command, while changes relative to that original version may be seen
     using the 'gcfg delta' command.
 .
  4. Flags can also be associated to the file, for any purpose that may be
     required by the operator.
     One such flag is the "@EDITED" flag, which is set as soon as the file
     has been modified with 'gcfg edit'.
     Flags management is performed using the 'gcfg flag', 'gcfg unflag' and
     'gcfg flagged' commands.
 .
 A global overview of changes can then easily be obtained using the 'gcfg list'
 command, or even saved in a Postscript file using the 'gcfg a2ps' command.
 .
 All modified files being within the scope of a single GIT repository, backup,
 versions tracking and collaborative management are easily performed thanks
 to GIT.
